# development-of-a-simple-one-ready-queue-and-one-I-O-queue-operating-system-simulation
The simulation requires: A process control block (PCB) structure including a Process ID (PID), a CPU usage term (CUT), an I/O request term (IRT), and a waiting term (WT). Use of the computer’s internal clock to get the time (seconds) values and the system’s random number generator. The ready queue and I/O queues to be arrays of structures. The array size is left to the student to determine.
